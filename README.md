# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  * Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source.
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## File and Class Structure

<img src="file_structure.png"/>

#### 1. `controller.h` and `controller.cpp`

#### 2. `game.h` and `game.cpp`

#### 3. `snake.h` and `snake.cpp`

#### 4. `renderer.h` and `renderer.cpp`

## New Game Features

### Increased Difficulties
1. The snake will die if he hits the wall.
2. Randomly generated rocks at the game start.

### More Fun
1. Magic Fruits
2. Wormholes

### Additional Features
1. The window title will now display the current speed, level.
2. The snake's speed will increase in a proportional manner (ie. speed +10% after eating a normal food).

### Original Game Bugs Fixed
1. Fix: The food might be generated outside the game window.

## Rubric Points Addressed

#### Loops, Functions, I/O
1. 

#### Object Oriented Programming
1.
